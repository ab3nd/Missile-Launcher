Version 0.4.2
	Avoid triggering the "ignore duplicate command" check on fire, since
	that command is auto-stopped. Now movement between fire isn't needed.

Version 0.4.1
	Implement diagonal movement commands.
	Thanks to Jonas Andradas <j.andradas at gmail.com>!

Version 0.4
	Implement usb_interrupt_read to check if we have reached a maximum
	position and stop movement to avoid breaking the missile launcher.
	(This included rearranging code to have a worker child who does the
	missile controlling since it needs to be able to spin in a loop
	while moving. Doing this in the main thread/process would lock up
	the user-interface.)

Version 0.3.2
	Handle key repeat kicking in after a while when controlling the device
	with the keyboard and doing "big movements".
	Raise delay to 7 seconds again for automatically stopping the device
	after initiating the firing sequence.
	Added a nicer error dialog (intead of "assertion failed" console
	output) shown when device not plugged in.

Version 0.3.1
	Change debug "control message returned" printout to a warning
	message that's only printed when error is returned.
	Add About dialog.
	Update TODO items in the README file.
	Added keyboard shortcuts for control:
		up/down/left/right on arrows or numeric keyboard 8/2/4/6,
		fire on numeric keyboard 5.

Version 0.3
	Wrote GTK+ interface using Glade and imported control code
	from previous version.

Version 0.2
	cleaned up source, made it possible to control the device.

Version 0.1
	Captured up, down, left, right, fire with Benoits USB Sniffer and
	converted it to C using lindi's usbsnoop2libusb.pl script.
